== ADR 5: Change relationship with properties from association to property

=== Status

rejected

=== Context

A definition of relationship with properties pointing to the current `@RelationshipProperties` annotated property class creates a Spring Data association.
Because the annotated class is not an entity this should not be an association in the first place but an entity property.
The contextual problem came up in the discussion of the refactoring of the relationship with properties (ADR-6).

=== Decision

Treat relationship with properties as properties on the defining entity.


=== Consequences

Requires refactoring of internal schema creation and mapping. There should not be any consequences user-facing.
