== ADR 8: Strictness of node mapping

=== Status

accepted

=== Context

Up until 6.0.1 included SDN might map arbitrary nodes onto domain classes if there's no exact fit.
We could keep it that way or be more strict about what to map.
This became apparent while working on hydrating domain objects on paths.

=== Decision

SDN prior to 6.0.2 did the following when there was not exactly one node with the primary target label in the result set:

* Check if there are structures having a `MAP` type in the result record
* Take the first one

As it happens, driver type `MAP` is not mutual exclusive from `NODE` or `RELATIONSHIP`.
That means a mapping request for an entity labeled `A` and a record containing only nodes labeled `B` and `C`
would either map `B` or `C` to the entity.

These results are not desirable and would lead in the worst case to data loss (attributes not being populated
with a write afterwards) or to a non-deterministic mapping in case SDN was dealing was custom query that did return
`*` without enumerating columns explicitly.

The decision was made to be strict, both in what types are mapped as fallbacks (only "pure" maps) and that
only nodes with a matching label are mapped.

In the context of this, the `Neo4jEntityConverter` has been made stateful as well so that it is able to
distinguish between objects it has already seen and objects that are new.

=== Consequences

Some users might see an exception of type `NoRootNodeMappingException` or a general `MappingException`.
This happens usually on either custom queries that don't contain all the necessary content or on mappings
that like we had in the `RepositoryIT`. There we needed to fix a test that accidentally created DTO projections
based on data that wouldn't have fit the original entity.
