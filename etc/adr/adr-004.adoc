== ADR 4: Drop the notion of the `NodeManager`

=== Status

accepted

=== Context

We introduced the `NodeManager` as a pendan to Hibernates `EntityManager` and with it, a concept of a persistence context, tracking changes.
This setup is required for updating only changed properties and also having implicit saves.

=== Decision

The previous versions of SDN and OGM all copied the concept of having a tracking of entities.
We decided against it this time to remove complexity.
We will update all properties each time a node is save, relying on the database to do this in an efficient way.

Relationships will be updated via smart queries.

=== Consequences

The biggest impact will probably more network traffic with models having a huge number of properties on a single domain object.
