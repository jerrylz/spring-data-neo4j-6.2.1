== ADR 3: Public classes that are part of internal API only must be final

=== Status

accepted

=== Context

Due to the fact that we are not yet on the module path, we need to have some classes public defined that are not meant
to be part of the public API.

=== Decision

Those classes should be marked `@API(status = API.Status.INTERNAL, since = "6.0")` as well as made final to at least
prevent people from inheriting from them.

=== Consequences

Potentially problems with some Spring proxies.
Need to be solved on a case by case incident.
