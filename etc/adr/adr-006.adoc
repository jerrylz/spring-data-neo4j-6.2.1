== ADR 6: Refactor definition of relationship with properties

=== Status

accepted

=== Context

The current implementation of relationship with properties has two major flaws:

. No possibility to create derived finders reaching into the target entity.
. Impossible to create two relationships of the same type connecting the same target node.

=== Decision

Don't use the format of the `Map<Entity, RelationshipPropertiesClass>` but instead define the target node within the `@RelationshipProperties` class.

=== Consequences

Users will have to refactor the existing `@RelationshipProperties` based relationships.
